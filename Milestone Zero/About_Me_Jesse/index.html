       <h2> ABOUT ME :</h2>
        <p>
        My name is Jesse Kelly. I am a Senior here at Florida Atlantic University, and a graduate from Palm Beach State College. My major is computer science with aims to get into AI and Deep Learning. I have a true passion for music production as well, and currently have an album in the works for over a year now. Originally, I am from Pennyslvania where I also attended a year of community college before I moved here to the Palm Beach County area for school. You will find some of my hobbies listed below as well as a link that takes you to one of my personal creations. If you've never seen Princess Mononoke, you're missing out!</p>
