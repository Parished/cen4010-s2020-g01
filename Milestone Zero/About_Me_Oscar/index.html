    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I'm passionate about technology. Since a young age, I've been known by family and friends as the "techy guy". Willingly forced by others to save their devices, from malware to figure out how to set up the printer. For what is worth, it pushed me to pursue Computer Science.</p>
    <p>I love the internet, technology, and building beautiful things.</p>
